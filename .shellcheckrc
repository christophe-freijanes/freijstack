disable=SC2153  # Possible misspelling (false positives on env vars)
disable=SC2012  # Use find instead of ls (acceptable for simple listings)

# Keep enabled: critical issues
# - SC1xxx: Syntax errors
# - SC2001-2100: Semantic errors (logic bugs, security)
# - Command not found, undefined variables, etc.

# - error: Always shown (syntax errors, undefined vars)
